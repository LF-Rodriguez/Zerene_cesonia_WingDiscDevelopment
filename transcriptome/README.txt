These files contain the sequences of the transcriptome assembled de-novo using the EvidentialGene pipeline fed with individual assemblies created using SPADES.

* Evegene_spades_10M.fa : Filtered transcriptome assembly, using individual SPADES assemblies constructed with 10M reads of each library
* Evegene_spades_10M_unigenes: Same transcriptome assembly containing only one transcript per gene (removing isoforms) as selected by EvidentialGene
